# 🌌 Star Wars SPA

A responsive, single-page web application (SPA) built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind/Bootstrap optional), and vanilla JavaScript. It consumes the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) API to display data from the Star Wars universe — including characters, films, starships, and planets — with a dark theme inspired by the Galactic Empire.
